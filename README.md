# Quetzalcoatl :snake: :bird::eyeglasses:
Understand how people are talking of your shows base on your query

# I - WHAT IS IT?
The Queztzalcoatl project is the ability to **excavate the Twitter API to extract insights about any topic that people talk about**. From a topic, you should be able to understand how people react using the power of sentiment analysis, text analysis.

# IV - ABOUT THE PROJECT
I started this project a long time ago as my very first Python project. At first, I used some webscraping with Selenium as I didn't know how to use and API. As my experience with Python grew, I switched to the API and bash scripting and started think automation.

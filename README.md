*Understand how people are talking of your shows base on your query*

## WHAT IS IT?
The Queztzalcoatl project is the ability to **excavate the Twitter API to extract insights about any topic that people talk about**.  
From a topic, you should be able to understand how people react using the power of text mining.

## ABOUT THE PROJECT
I started this project a long time ago as my very first Python project.  
At first, I used some webscraping with Selenium as I didn't know how to use an API. As my experience with Python grew, I switched to the Tweeter REST API and bash scripting and started think automation.  
Now, I am willing to create a package, or even an API in which it would be possible to track an information inside a topic.
